# acl_search_lib

This is a rewrite for HyperSplit packet classification 
algorithms. It can be used as a lib for IPv4 based 
five tuples or three tuples acl matching. HyperSplit is 
among the best packet algorithms. It has faster lookup speed 
as well as small memory size compared to DPDK ACL algorithm.
